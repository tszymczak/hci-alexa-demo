		    <h1>HCI Alexa Skill</h1>
		    <p>This is a prototype of our Alexa skill for human-computer interaction class. Type something in the box to simulate talking to Alexa. We also simulate the Show screen. Depending on which question you ask, relevant information appears on an interface mockup. Since the Show has a touch screen, a finished product would allow you to interact with the screen like a mobile app.</p>
            <p>Here is a list of questions this Alexa skill mockup understands, along with a few alternate phrasings for each:<br>
