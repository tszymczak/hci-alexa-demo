# hci-alexa-demo
This is a mockup/prototype of an Alexa skill for La Roche students, designed as part of a group project for human-computer-interaction class.

It's hosted at [https://tszymczak.github.io/hci-alexa-demo/index.html](https://tszymczak.github.io/hci-alexa-demo/index.html).

I would like to thank my fellow group members for helping me with this project:
* Nuh Hamilton: Project Manager / Team Lead
* Joseph Terlecki: Subject Matter Expert
* Dory Elizabeth Beltran Gomez: UX/UI Designer. Provided me with the pictures.
* Thomas Szymczak: That's me. Wrote all the code myself.
* ... : Administrative Assistant. I will list their name once they give me permission.
